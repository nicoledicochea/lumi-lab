**We're brighter than your average inventory system.**

## An In-Progress FullStack Web App
What's a laboratory without inventory? A useless room full of expensive equipment.

I currently work as a Scientist for a Start-up that created the first all-in-one glucose monitor. It’s a unique, innovative product, but the rest of our practices hardly matched up. 

The inventory system consists of two main components:
 1. Excel sheets that made for a User Experience nightmare
 2. Human memory. The dreaded realization that “Oh, dang, I forgot to order this months ago and now we’ve got to scramble to buy more.”

I set out to solve this.

With LumiLab, staff can log in to view their Laboratory Inventory, add new stock, include important notes for specific items, and set reminders to restock.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
